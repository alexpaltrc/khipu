//! The one form: creating an expansion and editing one, which are the same screen with a different
//! title and a different verb.
//!
//! `EditState` is the whole form — every field the user can touch — and it lives in
//! `View::Edit`, so a half-written expansion survives switching screens and coming back.
//! `build_match` turns it into the `SimpleMatch` that gets saved, and `new_for_edit` turns a stored
//! one back into a form; those two have to stay each other's inverse, or reopening an expansion
//! shows something the user did not write.
//!
//! The trigger is split into prefix and body for editing and rejoined on save, so changing the
//! global prefix is a change to one setting and not to every trigger in the file.
//!
//! The date half of the form is a preset picker over [`crate::yaml::presets`] plus, when none of
//! them fits, the block builder in [`crate::ui::date_blocks`]. The month-language control appears
//! wherever a month is actually spelled out, presets and custom alike, because the version that
//! sat at the foot of the form read as missing.
//!
//! `shadowing_pair` warns about one relation only — one trigger being a prefix of another — and
//! deliberately does not warn about the pair the prefix box itself produces. Read its own comment
//! before adding a case to it; espanso's matcher makes most of the pairs that look dangerous safe.
//!
//! ## Three questions, in order
//!
//! A sentence on top says what the expansion will do, as it is being written: «Cuando escribas
//! :hola, Khipu lo cambiará por…». Under it, three numbered questions: **¿Qué vas a escribir?**,
//! **¿Qué quieres que aparezca?** and **¿Algo más?**. A step whose previous one is still empty is
//! drawn faint, never locked: the order is a suggestion, and anybody may fill them in any order.
//! The date and the blanks wait under «+ Añadir» until somebody asks for them; the name, the folder
//! and the star wait folded inside the third step, which is optional and says so.
//!
//! ## Leaving is asked about only when there is something to lose
//!
//! The form is copied as it stood when the screen was arrived at. Esc and Cancelar leave at once
//! while the draft still matches that copy, and ask «¿Descartar los cambios?» once it does not.
//!
//! ## Validation is a thing the form knows, not a thing saving discovers
//!
//! [`problem_with`] is worked out once per frame, before anything is drawn, and two places read it:
//! the message beside the field that causes it, and whether Guardar can be pressed at all. That is
//! the plan's rule — offer saving only when the form is valid — and it is the only arrangement that
//! makes the rule actionable, because a button that is dead for a reason printed somewhere else is
//! one nobody can act on. [`crate::app::AppState::save_edit`] still checks for itself: it is reached
//! from Ctrl+S and from tests as well as from this button.
